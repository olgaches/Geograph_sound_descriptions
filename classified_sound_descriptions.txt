The Legend: One stormy night in 1723, a very drunken farmer called Francis Brown, decided to ride to Derby, about eight miles. He met his wife's protests with the remark 'Ride I will if I have to halter the devil'. As he was trying to put the halter on what he thought was a horse, a flash of lightning revealed that the animal had horns. He was so overcome by this that he remained sober for the rest of his life and built the chapel next to his house. In reality he had tried to halter one of his cows in his drunken state.  A service is still held at this chapel on the last Sunday of the month, the farmer will give the key to see inside, (very nice) if you can find him and/or get past the noisy pack of dogs that roam around the farm!"

I discovered one such place, on the west coast of Scotland, when I was quite young, about 13 or 14. I was on holiday with my family, and we came there early one evening. We had been driving for some miles through forests and glens, and then suddenly and unexpectedly the most wonderful scene lay before us.   The sun had set but it was not yet dark. Sky and sea were silver, merging into one. Magical islands were dotted about, with wonderful Gaelic names - Eigg, Rum, Skye, and tiny anonymous islets, rising in black silhouettes as if floating in space. Little bays fringed the coast, washed smooth by the tide, and even the sand was silver. The air was fresh and clean, and there was tranquillity about the place, peace and stillness such as I had never experienced before. It was heartbreakingly beautiful, and the delicious shock of it moved me to tears.  We had planned only to spend a couple of days there, and then to go further north, but we could not tear ourselves away, and stayed the whole week. I have returned many times since, and although it has become so familiar, it never fails to affect me as it did that first time.  Some changes have occurred, of course, in the name of progress, new roads, buildings, and the like, but its essential character has not altered, and there is much of it where the modern world will never be able to intrude, thank goodness.  I would rather go there on holiday than almost anywhere else. Lying on some exotic beach in the sun holds no attraction for me. A gentle, heather perfumed breeze to stir the senses, ancient mountains, brooding glens, and the wonderful soft light are preferable any time.  The seas are shallow here, shallow and clear, hence the numerous tiny islets, some little more than heaps of rocks, which jut above the waves. Yet only half a mile inland lies Loch Morar, the deepest lake in Britain, if not in Europe, over a thousand feet in some places. It is a place of wild grandeur and great beauty, steeped in mystery and legend. They say a monster lives in its murky depths, akin to its cousin in Loch Ness, and when one has heard the tales first hand and seen the loch at its most forbidding, dark steel grey, wind-driven waves battering the rocky shore, it is easy to believe.  I have known the loch in all its guises. Balmy and benign, on a warm and lazy summer day with not the slightest breeze to ruffle its surface. I have lain there beside it, eyes closed, in utter calm and solitude, when it would have been easy to imagine myself on that exotic beach, had I cared to do so.  But I have been there too on days when it was moody and cold with low mists hiding the far reaches, an uneasy air about it, and when it was playful, sparkling and beguiling. I love all of this area, from the Ardnamurchan peninsula to Mallaig and Skye, and further north to Sutherland, but it is the loch which calls to me the most. Each time I am there I feel it is saying to me, It's okay for you to be here. You understand me. You belong here. Maybe one day I might live there, but perhaps not.

In the 19th century a curious custom existed when if, by the end of the Assizes in Lifford or Omagh courthouses, a jury could not reach a unanimous verdict in a case, they were sent to the verge of the county to be dismissed.

The undergrowth smells damp and earthy, with fox scent here and there. The bracken is tall, the foxgloves are making a last brave show against a backdrop of ragwort and thistles. (See [[198350]].) Rabbits are abroad, some quite tiny still, out for their supper, and wood pigeons scatter from their high perches. A  woodpecker calls noisily, winging his undulating way over the canopy. This is a good time to be alone in the forest. The tourists have all gone, and the woodland creatures become bolder. There is a chance of seeing the deer. On this occasion there were two, swift dark forms slipping silently away through the pines, so that one is never quite sure whether they are real or imagined in the dim light under the trees, where shadows move and branches rustle. But their tracks are evidence of their existence. One can wander undisturbed in this forest, at one with nature, until the failing light and sudden chill in the air suggest it is time to return to the cottage at the edge of the wood, and a welcome cup of tea!"

Guineafowl originate from Africa and are related to other game birds such as pheasants, turkeys and partridges.  They have a long history of domestication, and there are various colour variations apart from the natural colour of the wild-living Helmeted Guineafowl (Numida meleagris), called 'pearl'.  Because of their loud shrieking voices, guineafowl are often kept together with other fowl where they act as a security system against intruders or birds of prey.

Ruth Donaldson-Hudson related this story about her grandfather, this bridge being the one where the accident occurred. In 1883 or 1884 my Grandfather was hunting one day round Norton-in-Hales. A mile or two beyond Norton village a lane lead up across fields to Bellaport Old Hall and on its way passes under a low railway bridge. As my grandfather rode under the bridge, his horse suddenly took fright and reared up, giving his rider a terrible blow on the back of his head. When he came home from hunting, he said that his head ached but beyond that made light of his accident. Had anyone but known it he had been very severely concussed and he should have been kept in bed, in a semi-darkened room, for a week or more. As it was, within a few days of the accident he went up to London on his Parliamentary duties; and as one of Gladstone's Irish Home Rule Bills was then hotly under discussion, the House had several all-night, or late -night sittings - than which nothing could have been worse for a man with concussion of the brain. \tThe effects of the accident were not immediately felt or seen. But after a year or so he began to have terrible headaches, and he became extremely depressed to the point of melancholia. His doctor advised him to travel, and he made several trips abroad, to Norway and India among other places. Far from improving under this treatment, he gradually became iller and iller. From what I have been able to gather from various sources, he would have awful brain-storms and fits of wild screaming. A slow paralysis set in, too, and he had a special pony-drawn bath chair built, in which he could go out and take the air. There was always a resident doctor in the house and latterly he had a male nurse as well. Tragic as it was for him, it was no less for his wife and children. By the time the latter had reached their teens, an age at which they most needed a father to guide and counsel them, they were almost entirely cut off from him by his illness. It dragged on for several years, the paralysis increasing all the time, and towards the end his brain became seriously affected. He died in 1893, in his fifty-third year, an age at which most men are hardly past their prime."

These have made life on the Island more comfortable reducing the water shortages during the summer.  Visitors should still be very economical with water when on the Scillies though.  The major increase of comfort on the off-islands in the last 50 years was the introduction of mains electricity in the mid-eighties.  Before that, the chug of diesel generators starting-up at dusk was a feature of St Agnes.  You could tell where you were on the island's road by the different sounds that each farm's generator had.

The town of Selby became very prosperous and the new canal very busy.  But all this evaporated in 1826 with the opening of the Knottingley and Goole Canal, a longer and deeper cut off which avoided even more of the Aire.  Selby's trade was lost to Goole, which was near enough to the sea for packet boats to operate to Belgium and Holland.

The tower is 75 feet tall, and the golden orb above the cupola is a time ball, designed by Magnus Volk (of Brighton's electric railway fame) which rose hydraulically up the mast to fall on the hour under a land line command from Greenwich Observatory. However, and somewhat ironically, complaints about the noise of the falling sphere caused a premature end to its operation.   The Clock Tower has not been to everyone's taste, Nikolaus Pevsner infamously describing it as 'worthless', and there have been proposals over the years to remove it, primarily because of the obstruction to traffic it causes. However its importance to the people of Brighton was finally recognised when the council very belatedly granted it Grade II listed building status in 1999.

From far off, we come to see the guardian of the cemetery and consult with him; with the one who lives with the dead that sleep in the branches and the dead that sleep under the earth. He hears the sounds that climb and the sounds that descend, Nehewoue the guardian of the dead. What do the bones say to you, Nehewoue, when they crack in the branches with the wind's breath? Do you hear the worm in the flesh? Do you hear the eager hawk? Why have you become powerful and terrible, Nehewoue? It's because you live with the dead, and death is more powerful than life.

The recent brick entrance with extension on the right hides the original juniors entrance by which a six feet high wall ran northwards to the air raid shelters (?) near which was around arched doorway into the infants playground. A matching infants entrance was situated on the main building on the other side of the wall. Both entrances led to cloakrooms, then into the main hall.  Very practical, those targets on the wall, one of the few windowless surfaces at which a ball could be thrown. We didn't have those in the 1950s. Which bright spark decided to impede their use by putting a bench table in the way? Notice the horizontal black bricked line along the building, angled at 45 degrees. We used to throw a ball from about five metres (or yards, as we called them!) and catch it as it rebounded back into the air. Counting in fives the game was to succeed in achieving this as many consecutive times as possible without missing the bricks and the ball touching the ground, or dropping the catch. Then your mate had a go.  I wonder if the bell is still in the bell tower. I never heard it ring.  (Thanks to the school's own website for some of the historical information)."

Between the two vertical gravestones within the iron railings can be seen part of the boxtomb of Thomas Heslop, victim of the last duel to be fought in Wales on September 10th 1814. The story is he got into a dispute in a pub with some local gents following a partridge shoot, tempers became inflamed and he challenged a local solicitor, John Beynon.  But when, two days later, it was pistols at dawn in nearby Dan-warin fields, the victim was Heslop, shot, apparently treacherously, in the back by Beynon who was charged with manslaughter and subsequently fled to America. 'Poor Heslop' was buried in this quiet churchyard, far from his native West Indies. See http://www.newcastleemlyn.info/page14.html However recent research and examination of the fatal bullet (which was preserved in the attending doctor's family) reveals that Heslop was shot fair and square and Beynon deserves to be exonerated!

To-date 165 pups have been born this year at this section of coastline.  The gestation period of a grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) lasts for eleven and a half months; the timing of birth varies, beginning in September in west Wales and November in the Farne Islands and Norfolk. Pups weigh about 15 kilograms at birth and are born with a fluffy white coat. They suckle from their mother for 18 to 21 days and gain about 2 kilograms of weight per day. Towards the end of the nursing period the mother mates with one or more males, and after the pup is fully weaned it is left to fend for itself. The pups stay at the breeding colony for three to four weeks until they are fully moulted, living off their blubber reserves, before they go to sea and learn how to swim and fish.

At that time the Mount was the main feature in the hamlet of Salt Hill. The urban sprawl of Slough had yet to consume it.   However the mound's main claim to fame is that until 1844 it was the destination of the Eton Montem when every Whit Tuesday the boys of Eton College [[345572]] marched, army-style, to the location collecting 'salt' or money from visitors and passers-by. The ceremony dated back until at least 1561 and was regularly patronized by Royalty. In its later years it became a triennial event, with the tickets to the 1838 event costing one shilling. However in 1844 the masters of the College decided that the boys should be studying rather than indulging time in making their Montem costumes, decided that the ceremony was anachronistic and should be abandoned forthwith. In truth the real reason for its demise was that with the advent of the railways the ceremonies of 1841 and 1844 had attracted rowdy crowds brought by train from London, and the authorities feared that a serious riot could break out in a subsequent event. The Times, reporting the 1844 event tongue-in-cheek, described the crowd as mixed... Evidently the hoi-polloi were not to be welcomed.

The wings are divided by a pattern of veins into a number of areas that are referred to as cells. One of these, located near the centre of the wing (and shaped like an elongated hexagon), is called the discal cell; the markings in that cell can be helpful in determining the species (according to Collins Complete British Insects, the only other common species of cleg in Britain is H. crassicornis, although there are several other common species of horse-fly). Although my camera is not well suited to taking such pictures, it is possible to make out an orange area on the antennae; this is another feature that can be useful in making an identification.  The compound eyes of horse-flies are often colourfully banded, and this cleg is no exception; the presence of a gap between its eyes reveals this fly to be a female.

Up until the 1960s it was flood meadows for the River Alt, and in hard winters in the middle of the 20th century the ice was skated on by local inhabitants. In summer, birds such as Snipe and Redshank, now absent in the area, bred in the meadows.   From the 1960s the area was used as a landfill site, with this particular area filled in the mid 1970s, covered in topsoil and left. An interesting natural ecosystem then began to develop, with scarce breeding birds for the area such as Sedge Warbler, Grasshopper Warbler and Meadow Pipit, while Short-eared Owls were present in winter.   In the early 1980s, however, the land was reverted to agriculture, this apparently being a pre-condition of the initial permission to tip there. The whole area was ploughed and crops grown, but agriculture returned only briefly however, before the local farmer decided it wasn't worth tilling.

Even with every care possible you are driven from one side to another, till your shoulders are almost dislocated; for they are so intently employed with meditating on the good things they have heard, and the enjoyments of another life, that they have no time to look before them.

Alas, the sands and the pleasure steamers have long since departed. The River Kent used to flow past the mile-long Promenade, but the River's course migrated south leaving the sands to become a salt marsh that is now grazed by small flocks of sheep.

The events of the day celebrate the life not of some pirate or soldier as might be expected given the nature of the day's happenings, but the founder of the science of neurology, Thomas Willis. Thomas Willis along with fellow medics Lister and John Hunter is buried in Westminster Abbey . He left a considerable fortune and three manor houses in the Fenny Stratford district, eventually inherited by his grandson. This grandson was the rather eccentric historian, Browne Willis, famed for his unkempt appearance and for having paid for the building of St Martin's parish church in the town at a juncture when the place had fallen onto rather hard times. The church was dedicated to St Martin as Thomas Willis had for a long time practised in St Martin-in-the-Fields , and died on St Martin's day, November 11.  Thomas Willis is commemorated by a sermon being said in the church (fee for the preacher one guinea), by an evening meal - which should feature turkey - in The Bull, an ancient tavern, and most enjoyably of all by the firing of the Fenny Poppers. These are described as ceremonial cannon, looking like large iron beer mugs, their handles big enough for Goliath's mitts. The originals, said to date from 1740, eventually deteriorated and one cracked, so they were re-cast in 1859. There are six, weighing roughly 20lb each, with a 'barrel' firing upwards of six inches by a bit under one inch, loaded with a charge of one ounce or more of black powder.  Over the years the firing has supposedly damaged the roof of The Bull and the fabric of the church, so lately the ceremonies take place on a sports field, Leon Recreation Ground. Here at noon, 2pm and 4pm a metal rod about twelve feet long, its end made red-hot in the church furnace, is used to touch off the cannon.  By tradition the vicar has the honour of firing the first, the rest being in the hands of other worthies of the town. Whether this is sharing the glory or the risk is debatable. Quite why the learned physician's grandson decided on the Fenny Poppers as a means of remembering his relative is unsure, but a custom involving 18 loud bangs and a boozy dinner surely cannot be faulted."

What visitors see today are the substantial remnants of the last in a sequence of such monuments erected between c. 3000 BC and 1600 BC.  The Stonehenge we see today is aligned on the midwinter setting sun and the midsummer sunrise.  Stonehenge's orientation in relation to the rising and setting sun has always been one of its most remarkable features. Whether this was because its builders came from a sun worshipping culture or because - as some have asserted - the circle and its banks were part of a huge astronomical calendar, remains a mystery.  Evidence of the peoples who built Stonehenge exists through their tools, artefacts, pottery and even the contents of their graves. Some of these are displayed in the museums at Salisbury and Devizes.  The first monument at Stonehenge consisted of a circular bank and ditch with a ring of 56 pits now known as the Aubrey Holes. Later monuments all used and reused the stones we see today, many of which were brought from some distance away. The main final phase comprised the construction of an outer circle of huge standing stones - super-hard sarsens, from the Marlborough Downs. These were topped by lintels, forming a ring. Inside this stood a horseshoe of five still-larger constructions, known as trilithons: pairs of uprights with a lintel across each. All the stones were connected using mortise-and-tenon joints. Smaller bluestones, from the Preseli Hills in South Wales, were also arranged in a ring and a horseshoe, within the great circle and horseshoe of sarsen stones. In an earlier phase, these bluestones had been erected in a different arrangement.  A World Heritage Site, Stonehenge and all its surroundings remain powerful witnesses to the once great civilisations of the Stone and Bronze Ages which existed here around 3,700 BC to 1600 BC.   Stonehenge is surrounded by 1,500 acres of land owned by The National Trust, with excellent walks.  [[1626228]] [[1626231]] [[1626243]]"

It is approximately 10 miles long and is used for walking, cycling, horse riding and the quiet enjoyment of the countryside. It runs from East Grinstead to Groombridge. The Forest Way runs along an old railway line and is an important habitat for wildlife as a 'green corridor'. The way lies within the Forest Way Country Park. The Park lies within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and passes through or close to East Grinstead, Forest Row, Hartfield, Withyham and Groombridge. There are circular trails varying in length and difficulty. Walkers may spot swallows, badger tracks deer and foxes, amongst the fields and woodlands. The way follows the line of the old East grinstead to Groombridge railway. The railway opened in 1866. Although a busy commuter line, it was axed with the Beeching cuts in 1966. Ironically, Dr Beeching lived near Forest Row and regularly travelled up to London on the line when he was Chairman of British Rail.

Whilst trying to photograph a squirrel, I was conscious of some movement, and the blackbird landed nearby; he commenced chirping away. I'm no expert on bird language, but it sounded along the lines of I want food. As I moved, he took off, and again landed nearby. The chirping continued. As I had lost sight of the squirrel, I looked around, trying to see where he had gone. I felt some movement, and found that the blackbird had landed on my camera; he looked at me, and chirped loudly. I concluded that he must have been hand-reared. I held out an arm, and he swiftly flew from camera, to arm, and then hopped to my hand ... no food! He took off, and I moved a few paces away, still looking for the squirrel. Seconds later, the blackbird landed ... on my head!  Tip of the day: How to remove a blackbird from your head.  (1)  Don't panic! (2)  Gently raise a hand, move it up the side of your head and onto your crown. (3)  Allow the blackbird to hop from your head, onto your hand. (4)  Gently remove your hand, and allow the blackbird to fly to a convenient perch.  I moved away, but the blackbird keep me company for half an hour, much to the disgust of the squirrels, who mostly kept to a safe distance. One was brave enough to come up, and bite my finger.  By 10.35, a small crowd had gathered, and were pointing fingers, and cameras, at the blackbird. One of the Keepers, who came in to give the squirrel talk, said Hello Barry, and confirmed that he (I'm not sure; from the colour, he may well turn out to be female) had been reared by Laura, having been brought into the centre when just a few days old. He had only been released a couple of days previously.  Barry dominated the Red Squirrel talk (none of the squirrels turned up), and the Keeper was reported to have said No-one  listened to my talk, they were all looking at Barry. Later in the morning, Barry attended the Fox talk; trying the same tactics, he nearly finished up as a tasty snack for one of the foxes.  Later, after a nap (on a bench overlooking a fox enclosure), he was seen getting to know some sparrows.  Let's hear it for Barry; ace entertainer. http://www.britishwildlifecentre.co.uk/homeframeset.htm [[1983076]]  Sadly, Barry's story did not have a happy ending; he died, after flying into a window.

This location is on the northern edge of Brownsea Island, within the Dorset Wildlife Trust reserve. From this high vantage point, the ground drops steeply to the shore, and is densely wooded. I thought that the location might be suitable for red squirrel (Sciurus  vulgaris) photographs, since the woodland contains a few chestnut trees. As I was settling myself down for what I hoped to be a short wait, a small fly became lodged in my eye, causing a certain amount of discomfort (took almost four hours  to remove!).  So; I decided on the camera settings, and waited. After about ten minutes, the light had deteriorated. I changed settings, and tried a test exposure of this tree. As the shutter clicked, I heard a noise, behind me. Turning, I saw that a squirrel had run behind me, and was sitting on a tree stump, not ten feet away. Needless to say, by the time I turned the camera towards the spot, he was nowhere to be seen!  I waited for another squirrel to climb up the slope; minutes later, this one obliged. The squirrel climbed into the tree, as I had hoped; however, it saw me, and let out an alarm call! On that basis, I thought that I might as well stand up, and attempt some photographs. The first couple were not in focus, but I was able to see that this squirrel was female. She then crouched on the branch, for a while, and stared at me. Bored with that, she took some nuts from the tree, and scampered off.  http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-brownsea_island/w-brownseaisland-wildlife/w-brownseaisland-wildlife-red_squirrels.htm http://www.dorsetwildlifetrust.org.uk/"

See [[2404844]] for a description of the monument.  The large building in the background is [[431894]], which is all quiet on this occasion (during the school holidays). OLSP arose from the merger of Notre Dame (a girls' school - see [[2335961]]) and St Patrick's (a boys' school).  Similar to Arthur's Seat, but larger, is an eminence called [[2356885]], which is located in the wooded north-eastern corner of the park; part of that area is visible at the right-hand edge of the photo; see [[2404694]] for another view. Castle Hill gave the Castlehill area of Dumbarton its name; see also [[1096046]]."
Stephen McKay,54.455491000000002,-2.160994000000000,geophony,www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2220230,"Approached from any direction across empty bleak moorland, the appearance of this inn - the only building for, quite literally, miles around - is an astonishing sight. It claims to be the highest inn in Great Britain at 1732 feet above sea level, which is probably true but as is the way with such things there is an alternative candidate, in this case the Cat and Fiddle Inn in the Peak District. Unlikely as it may seem, this area was once important for coal mining and the inn no doubt owes its origins to the need to slake the miners' thirst. The Tan Hill Colliery closed as recently as 1945 but the inn has since found a new role catering for the many walkers who come this way - it is right on the Pennine Way - and others who come by car via the moorland roads. Many people will remember the television adverts from the 1980s which featured the late Ted Moult extolling the virtues of a particular brand of double glazing by demonstrating that, despite a gale howling outside, a feather dropped inside one of the inn's newly-fitted windows would fall gently to the ground undisturbed. The inn nowadays has bed and breakfast accommodation and even a wedding licence. The main building dates from the 17th century but the extensions to the rear are much more recent."

The male is all black with a yellow eye ring and beak.  Females are duller and browner.  young birds are a rather redder brown with pale spots.    Blackbirds nest on a variety of sites from ground level to 40 feet high.  They build solid nests of grasses reinforced with mud and often manage to rear four broods in a season.  The female incubates three to five blue-green eggs with brown spots, which hatch in about thirteen days.  In addition to the resident blackbirds, there are substantial numbers of immigrants from the Continent which overwinter in Britain.  The mellow song of the blackbird stands out in the dawn chorus, but when disturbed it flies off with a series of loud, chattering cries.  It is said that if a blackbird nests anywhere in your house then you can look forward to a year of good fortune.   Dreaming of a blackbird may be a sign of misfortune for you in the coming weeks. It also means you lack motivation and that you are not utilising your full potential. However, the sight of two blackbirds sitting together is a symbol of peace and a good omen. Dreaming of a flying blackbird is said to bring good fortune."

The Grey Squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) was introduced to Britain from North America in the mid 19th century by wealthy Victorian landowners looking for a 'novelty' species to release on their estates. Since then this intelligent, adaptable and hardy animal has spread across parks, gardens and woodlands driving out the native Red Squirrel from its habitats and feeding grounds and sending them to the brink of extinction, out-competing the Red in nearly all its life stages including resistance to disease. Recent research suggests that it will also compete for food with the already struggling native woodland birds, in 2000 the Forestry Commission estimated that Grey Squirrels can cause up to 10 million pounds worth of damage in both the economic and amenity value of woodland areas thus making it a major threat to our native biodiversity. Indeed, this threat has become so great the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), www.iucn.org/ , have listed it as being one of the 100 worst invasive species globally."

Astbury Mere was originally a sand quarry, in 1984 operations ceased and the quarry closed. For over 50 years the local residents had put up with a noisy major industry on their doorsteps, wildlife started to gain a foothold and it was thought that the area might become a local amenity. But a proposal was put forward to construct a major industrial complex on the site. Dismayed, the locals set up an action group to fight the proposals and intensive negotiations were started.  After years of uncertainty the landowners agreed to sub divide their estate; half the site would instead be developed for housing whilst the remainder would be given over as open space and so began the creation of Congleton's first Country Park.  The action group then became the Astbury Mere Trust, a registered charity and a limited company whose main objectives are to: Provide for the benefit of the inhabitants of Congleton and district a managed and maintained country park at Astbury Mere in perpetuity for recreation or other leisure time occupation with the object of improving the conditions of life for the said inhabitants. Since its opening in 1989 the Country Park has become a valued recreational resource for the inhabitants of Congleton and beyond. In this time the Park has matured, not only in physical terms with the growth of trees and shrubs but also in its evolution as an important outdoor recreational and learning resource.

All Sivigniac monasteries were absorbed into the Cistercian order in 1147 it and the Neath Abbey became quite a wealthy house after early economic difficulties.  Its estate expanded as far as Devon, Somerset as well as the nearby county of Glamorgan. The community soon outgrew the original 12th-century buildings necessitating major reconstruction throughout the 13th and 14th centuries.  The remains of the west range are relatively complete and date from 1170-1220.  The lay brothers, the manual workers on the estate, initially occupied this. The abbey church was rebuilt in the period 1280 to 1330 and the high quality of the architecture can be seen in the remnants of the original building.  Dissolved in 1539, the estate passed to Sir Richard Williams in 1542 and he was responsible for regenerating its fortunes and it was either him, or perhaps his son, who converted the south-eastern part of the cloister ranges into a grand mansion. This was built over the monk's dormitory and latrine, and is recognised today by its large rectangular windows of dressed stone. By 1600 property had passed to Sir John Herbert and it remained occupied throughout the 17th century.   With the passage of time the abbey precinct was turned into a copper smelting and casting workshop but this in turn passed into history until, in the early 1920's, the site was gradually cleared of the industrial debris that had accumulated from this period of its existence.   Today the Abbey ruins offer a quiet retreat beside the Tennant Canal.We have Henry VIII to thank for these beautiful ruins, and others like it, but can only wonder at what glories they might have become had they not been destroyed."

Hardy Lane is unusually wide, although at the Hardy Farm end the carriageway narrows, with a large area of verge in front this last block of houses. The planners had in mind a  future extension across the river to Sale in mind, to form a significant arterial road. When the M63 Sale Eastern Bypass was being designed and constructed in the 1960s proposals were in place for a new link road, to be carried across the low lying land at Hardy Farm on a 20ft high embankment.  This was never built, although the motorway junction (now M60 J6) was built with this in mind.   Although spare from thundering traffic passing their front doors, these houses will in future have the frequent swish of trams, as the Metrolink line to Manchester Airport will run along Hardy Lane - the barriers seen here relate to works to move utilities in advance of the start of construction proper."

The ruins of the past can be seen deep in the forest near the river: there are remnants of the landlord's mansion, an ancient Holy Well, Ice House, walled garden, the ruins of Fleming's Castle (part of the Plantation of 1607), a military barracks, and a bridge built it is said by the Normans in the 12th century, across which Cromwell's troops in the 17th marched to attack the castle of the O'Reillys at nearby Muff [[3002665]] . Lady's Lake is the only sign that the village of Cabra once stood here (that was before 1760); the lake used to take the water that passed through the village Flax Mill.

Using tools fashioned by his own hand, he plied himself to the task with dexterity and good humour and there was never heard tell of a dissatisfied customer. Indeed the busy ding-dong of his anvil hung in the air like the song of a lark on a Summer's day and rivalled the bell of the nearby church in clarity and resonance. The Forge was also an important gathering place for the youth of the area as Paddy's company always ensured a bit of craic. A pub with no beer, in fact. How things have changed. Gone are the visitors. Gone are the cheery yarns and the idle banter. Gone is the huff puff of the bellows. Gone is the snarl of the fire. Gone is the ding dong of the hammer on the anvil.

On occasion I have even pre-empted their shout (I can detect a boy racer exhaust note or a hair-dryer motorbike engine being driven beyond its limits a mile off and know what to expect), and yelled and waved first by a split second, much to our mutual enjoyment.   No one has ever done it when on foot - yet. I look forward to that occasion. As it would be great to find out what they are yelling. I always welcome constructive criticism."

In this cramped accommodation, a dozen or so Friends and their children gathered each week, gaining steadily in strength and numbers. Sometimes there were not enough chairs for everyone, the surroundings were noisy and meeting was occasionally disturbed by people seeking morning coffee.  Our present premises were purchased in August 1931. By now Roundhay had a regular attendance of between thirty and forty and all the activities of a well established meeting.  By the mid fifties, with membership exceeding a hundred, the need for larger premises came under discussion once again and the result was a new meeting room, constructed in 1957, in the rear garden of the bungalow.

The Old Goods Shed (now Watchet's Boat Museum) is at the end of the car park. The current bus station is also located at the far end of the car park. On the right, one sees the back of the Library and the Phoenix Drop-in Centre (formerly the Red Cross Building). Middle ground right, one sees the Harbour Road Public Conveniences, two impressive B&B establishments and the Methodist church. Further along is the (two-tone) former Van Heusen Shirt factory that is now the town's doctor's surgery. One would have seen a very different and much noisier scene here in the 1960s. From behind the camera position, a spur off the railway dropped down a short sharp incline to the current car park level. It then branched into a couple of sidings that ran to the goods shed - which then had a fairly large open-sided barn spanning the lines in front of it. This barn sometimes housed truckloads of wood-pulp and esparto grass overnight. Tank engines would drop down onto these sidings, and then do a switchback onto another line that ran back past the photographic position to a fan of sidings on the East Quay. Two hand-propelled railway turntables also turned railway trucks through 90 degrees, to enable them to run out onto the East Pier. These trucks were usually pulled out onto the East Pier, one-at-a-time, by a tractor. After being loaded by crane with North African esparto grass or Baltic wood pulp bales, the trucks were assembled into short trainloads on the East Quay, and then pulled by tank engine over to the goods shed. Such trains were then reversed up the incline, and then switchbacked onto a freight loop, which rejoined the main railway track at a point just before the narrow gap between the station platform and the goods shed. (Presumably this freight loop would have constituted the run-around line for locos for those few years when Watchet was the original terminus of the West Somerset Railway.) Such freights then passed under Watchet Station's road bridge, and left the mainline shortly beyond it on the paper mill sidings. So when negotiating the foot level-crossing to the East of the Station, pedestrians had to look out for trains on the mainline and the freight loop, trains on the incline and trains on the quayside switchback. Some esparto grass and wood-pulp was also despatched to the Silverton Paper Mill in Devon by rail. A very shrill crossing bell announced the arrival of through trains, but I seem to remember that it did not ring for the described freight movements. Pedestrians instead had to keep an eye-out and ears open for cursing tank engine crews. In the 1970s, the sidings were removed. Imported timber was then seen stacked from the quay right along to the goods shed."

The railway had a passing loop and signal box at about this point until the mid-1960s. Walking along this sometimes gloomy stretch could be a bit eery on a latish Summer evening, because the breathing of the waiting steam train and the rumbling of the passing train made you sort of half wonder whether a ghost train would suddenly appear on the mineral line itself. Or even that you were just hearing the ghostly sounds of the Mineral Line's past, complete with brief snatches of conversation between drivers and signalmen.

It afforded enough water to establish  a mill (the buildings to the left of shot are named Trin Mill in its honour) but that supply was lost when the New Cut was founded in the early 1800s. The Bathurst Basin was dug to replace the old mill pond and named after a nineteenth century M.P., Charles Bathurst.  Today it is a quiet marina, but the old lock gates were blocked shut during the war to stop the Floating Harbour draining if it was hit by bombing. At the far end of the basin is a blue footbridge that once was a harbour railway bridge, right beside the Ostrich pub."

The steep zig-zag wynd descended from Castle Hill down to the West Port via the Grassmarket until street improvements in the first half of the 19th century cut through its upper and lower ends. The steps below the lamp post lead to Victoria Street.  Up until the turn of the 19th century the 'Bow' was the noisiest part of Edinburgh, being the main area where the hammermen (metalworkers) plied their trade - whitesmiths, coppersmiths and pewterers.  Yet however disagreeable their clattering might seem to strangers, it is generally admitted that the people who live in the West Bow became habituated to the noise, and felt no inconvenience whatever from its ceaseless operation upon their ears. Nay, they rather experienced inconvenience from its cessation, and only felt annoyed when any period of rest arrived and stopped it. Sunday morning, instead of favouring repose, made them restless; and when they removed to another part of the town, beyond the reach of the sound, sleep was unattainable in the morning for some weeks, till they got accustomed to the quiescence of their new neighbourhood. -- Robert Chambers, Traditions of Edinburgh, 1824  The poet James Ballantine remembered the old street from childhood before it was swept away in the 1830s.  The auld Wast Bow sae steep an' crookit,  Whaur mony cozy dens were coukit [hidden],  Whaur beggars hoosed, an' blackguards joukit [hid]  Frae law's keen grup,  Whaur daidlin [idling] bodies sat an' souket [sucked] Hale puncheons up.

Now the A3 passes below in the Hindhead tunnel, and the old road (whose line can be seen curving along the hill) has been dug up; the National Trust have surfaced the bridleway, opened out a lot of the undergrowth, thinned the trees, and erected information boards along the route; and generally the Sailor's Stone is much less something one stumbles across by accident, as I first did.

As time went by, the land was also used to keep poultry and ducks. The number and variety of animals grew, as did the range of activities carried out on the site. This eventually became Spitalfields City Farm. Since then the farm lost some land along its northern side when the East London Line, which was previously in a tunnel, was upgraded to become part of London Overground and was put in a cutting through part of the farm's land. As compensation the farm took some land from Allen Gardens (a rather nondescript park) to the west. As well as a variety of animals including sheep, pigs, goats, cattle and ferrets the farm runs a variety of activities including a Young Farmers Club and Community Food Growing. See http://www.spitalfieldscityfarm.org/  for more information about the farm.  This photograph shows one of the growing areas with the London Overground rising  out of its tunnel behind and beyond that are some flats in Pedley Street.

In the cliff above is the waterfall that provided water for the shieling.   Hugh Miller visited the spot in 1844, and wrote a description of it. Rarely have I seen a more interesting spot, or one that, from its utter loneliness, so impressed the imagination ... A streamlet came pouring down from above in a long white thread, that maintained its continuity unbroken for at least two-thirds of the way; and then, untwisting into a shower of detached drops, that pattered loud and vehemently in a rocky recess, it gathered itself up into a lively little stream, and, sweeping past the shieling, expanded in front to a circular pond, at which a few milch cows were leisurely slaking their thirst ...  The shieling owes its existence to a major landslide, when a vast block of rock slid down and tilted, moving beds of rock down from the base of the cliffs. The mud and rock debris to landward of the landslip dammed the burn, creating a small lochan. In due course the burn carved an outlet through the Jurassic rocks and their overlying caps of lava, draining the lochan and leaving some good grazing land.  In the foreground are some of the drystane dykes built to contain the cattle in the grazing land. The cottage ruins is just to left of the point where the burn emerges on to the flatter ground."

The reflection rainbow appears above the horizon.

The site became associated with the Dakeyne family a flax mill was erected by Daniel Dakeyne and we know it was offered for sale in 1802 following bankruptcy. Things must have looked up because Daniel's sons, Edward & James, built the three storey mill seen here in 1826. The mills had a variety of water wheels and even a part built steam engine at the time of bankruptcy. The real innovation though was c1830 (the patent date) when the Dakeyne disc engine was built to utilise a 100' head of water and develop 35 horsepower. The engine was 10' diameter and weighed 7 tons. Sadly, both it and its house have long gone. There is a Gilkes water turbine still near the foot of the bell tower (visible right background).  The disc engine was apparently noisy and produced a roar that led the locals to say the mill was driven by a 'romping lion'. The engine belonged to the class of engines now called a swashplate engine or nutating disc engine.  The mill was latterly used for animal feed production but is now apparently used for storage and a degree of multiple occupancy."

Eventually 5 magnificent craft roared past in the distance, along the coast, and heading for the Range - I only hope there was time to warn the bombers who were working there! The event?

The trunk has a girth of 3.78m and its age has been estimated at 250 years [2]. It stands less than a kilometre from Cubbington, a quiet village close to Leamington Spa in Warwickshire. It also stands directly in the way of the proposed HS2 railway linking London to Birmingham [3]. After it is felled a 17m deep by 100m wide cutting will be dug and 36 trains an hour travelling at 250 mph will zoom past. Naturally the residents of Cubbington strongly oppose HS2. Whilst I strongly sympathise with their plight, I wouldn't want it in my backyard, I must say I have nothing against such developments per se. Without large investments in infrastructure in the past we wouldn't have the rail and road network we now take for granted and couldn't live without. But 50 billion [5]. That's a lot of money especially in these times of austerity. For what? So businessmen can get London twenty minutes or so faster. There will be no benefits whatsoever to the residents of Cubbington and a lot of costs. To catch the train they will have to travel north to Birmingham. 50 billion will pay for a lot of nurses. I am very sceptical of the cost/benefit analysis. Who will actually benefit? There is nothing for the North East in it. How much is a 250 year old pear tree worth? As I take my morning run out and back along two footpaths that cross the route it dawned on me there are no new footbridges marked on the HS2 route map where these paths are supposed to cross [4]. Surely crossings of Public Rights of Way have been thought about. Or perhaps the loss of local amenities is of no consequence.

The photo was taken in Martindale, an isolated valley in the north east Lakes. Famous for its herd of red deer which, as this is the rutting season, were constantly bellowing from dawn to dusk. The red roofed building was built in 1911 by Hugh Lowther, the Earl of Lonsdale, as a shooting lodge. It's known as The Bungalow and still retains its original decor and features. Well I tell a lie there. Originally it had an electrical supply powered by a small hydro plant in the beck. The cables and fittings are still there, solid copper wire insulated by fragile rubber and  cotton with a push button bell system to summon the servants. But today there is no electricity at the Bungalow.  In 1912 the German Emperor, the Kaiser, was a guest of the Earl at the lodge. He had been the Earl's guest twice before staying at the Earl's seat, Lowther Castle, the last time ten years before. The story goes that the Kaiser was particularly fond of shooting rabbits. The Earl had known of this so he had his gamekeepers trap hundreds of rabbits from around his estate and taken to a particular patch of woodland. The Earl then happened to mention to the Kaiser that he often finds a rabbit or two in a particular wood and maybe they ought to take a look. Upon their approach the gamekeepers released the rabbits and the Kaiser shot away to his heart's content. I wonder whether the conversation between the Earl and the Kaiser that night in the lodge sitting by the roaring fire was confined to just deer, hunting and rabbits. Or would there have been any hint of the tragedy that was to unfold just two years later.  Now, back to the question. Why are AA vans yellow? Well the favourite colour of the Earl of Lonsdale happened to be yellow such that he was often referred to as the Yellow Earl. His large collection of carriages were yellow. He had his own private railway carriage painted in his distinctive yellow livery. And I once read he had a yellow Rolls Royce although I may have imagined that. So when the Automobile Association was established and he became its first president, he allowed the organisation to use his distinctive yellow livery on their vehicles and which it still uses today.

Cluniac monks fleeing the invading Vikings are said to have disembarked here from Holy Island carrying valuables and the body of Saint Cuthbert after whom the church is named. They alighted at The Landing (situated to the right of this photo) which towards the end of the medieval period developed into an inland port. There is still a 'Custom House' in the village and 'The Old Anchor Inn' (currently staffed by an effervescent South African landlord) backing onto the Landing and the Stainforth Canal beyond.  The celebrated Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden is also associated with this area although his work on nearby Hatfield Chase had a detrimental effect on Fishlake where river straightening led to flooding both here and in Sykehouse and Snaith.  Also worth seeking out in the village are the windmills and the 'butter crosses' one of which can be seen on this picture. They may be the remnants of Saxon preaching crosses which later evolved into market crosses selling produce including in this area - eels. A stone river marker on the Landing also survives giving the nautical distance to Tinsley near Sheffield along the canal.  The Norman porch at the church's southern entrance should also be seen. It was described by Pevsner as perhaps the most lavishly decorated in Yorkshire.

Protected on the north side by the cliffs of Gull Crag up to 30m in height extending out to Castle Point and the broken rocks of Thorns Carr. A gash along these cliffs known as Rumble Churn [[2581219]] is described in a poem telling the tale of a local Northumbrian legend:  Loud was the roar on that sounding shore Yet still could the Knight discern, Louder than all, the swell and the fall Of the bellowing Rumble Churn!  With strange turmoil did it bubble and boil, And echo from place to place; So strong was its dash, and so high did it splash, That it washt the castle's base:  The spray, as it broke, appeared like smoke From a sea&#8722;volcano pouring; And still did it rumble, and grumble, and tumble, Rioting! raging! roaring!  From 'Sir Guy the Seeker' by Matthew Lewis (1808) http://literaryballadarchive.com/PDF/Lewis_22_Sir_Guy_the_Seeker.pdf  The place-names along the Northumberland coast are being researched for a future publication of the English Place-Name Society:  The first edition OS map (1895) shows that Rumble Churn originally referred to a longer inlet on the south-east of Dunstanburgh Castle. On the 1897 map that inlet is named Queen Margaret's Cove while Rumble Churn is shown in its present, northern location. In fact, the original site is a more convincing rumbler, and eighteenth-century visitors enjoyed being terrified by it.  The surf foams and roars in it, and the large round boulders at its inland end rumble when the tidal swell is strong, nicely matching the definition in the Scottish National Dictionary entry for the verb and noun rummle: 'Rummlekirns - Gullets on wild rocky shores, scooped out by the hand of nature; when the tide flows into them in a storm, they make an awful rumbling noise; in them are the surges churned' MEMS research blog, Newcastle University https://research.ncl.ac.uk/mems/researchblog/  There is a photo of Queen Margaret's Cove here [[410762]]"

It's a quiet village, with a population of just 149 at the last count in 25 houses. It wasn't always so. At one time it had two inns, The Horseshoe and The Crown, two shoemakers, two blacksmiths, a wheelwright and a grammar school. Of course in living memory it also had a youth hostel at Westerdale Hall but that is now too a private residence.  Perhaps the most interesting residents were the Knights Templar (see http://www.geograph.org.uk/snippet/12820 ), a military monastic order established in the 12th century to protect pilgrims en route to Holy places. Sort of mediaeval bodyguards. One theory claims that the Knights Templar are the direct descendants of modern freemasons. But of course that'll be a secret.  In the 16th century the Knights Templar lands were handed over to the Knights Hospitallers. This order was founded originally to provide care for sick, poor or injured pilgrims going to the Holy Land. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that their main site was at Westerdale Hall but that building dates from the 1840s when it was built as a shooting lodge for the Feversham Estate. The Knights Hospitallers were otherwise known as the Order of St John and are still in existence today, better known as the St. John Ambulance Brigade."

From bottom up, an organ pipe sits on its toe hole through which the air will be blasted to create the note. The air moves up through the conical foot, past the lower lip until it hits the languid which creates a flat sheet of air, which by Bernoulli's principle (the same one that keeps aeroplanes in the air !) a pressure difference is created in the region of the upper lip. Vibrations set up here, their frequency determined by the length and girth of the whole tube, are magnified by the resonance effect of the rest of the tube towering above the mouth. The result in pipes as huge as these is a great rumbling note that vibrates your whole body ! See also [[[2983593]]] to get an idea of their height. These thirteen pipes pretty-much fill the western wall of the south transept. Note: The diapason pipes of an organ are those that simply play the sound of a pipe organ rather than imitating another musical instrument. They are also sometimes called Principal or Principale. The largest diapason pipe at Exeter is 16' - whereas the pipes seen here culminating in the 32' monster belong to the Contra Violone register. See http://www.harrisonorgans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Exeter-full-spec.pdf (pdf file) for details of Exeter's magnificent organ."
